Title: Survival Prediction with Mutli-Task Logistic Regression
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Humza Haider
Maintainer: Humza Haider <hshaider@ualberta.ca>
Description: An implementation of Multi-Task Logistic Regression (MTLR) for R. 
  This package is based on the NIPS paper by Yu et al. (2011) which proposed MTLR for generating individual survival curves
  by learning feature weights which vary across time. This model was further extended to account for left and interval censored data.
